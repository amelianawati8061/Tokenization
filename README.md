# Tokenization
Tokenization in Natural Language Processing

This repository contains code and resources related to tokenization, an essential preprocessing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Tokenization involves breaking down text into individual units, or tokens, such as words or subwords, to facilitate further analysis and processing.

In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of tokenization using the popular TensorFlow library. The code demonstrates how to tokenize text data, convert tokens into numerical representations, and prepare the data for modeling tasks like text classification or sequence generation.

Key Features:
- Preprocessing the BBC articles fulltext and category dataset from Kaggle
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Tokenizing the text data using the TensorFlow Tokenizer
- Encoding the tokens into numerical sequences
- Building and training a deep learning model for text classification
- Visualizing model performance through loss and accuracy plots

The code and resources provided in this repository serve as a practical guide for understanding and implementing tokenization techniques in NLP tasks. Whether you are a beginner exploring NLP or an experienced practitioner looking to refine your tokenization skills, this repository will provide valuable insights and hands-on experience.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific projects. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
